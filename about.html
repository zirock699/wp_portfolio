            <p>
                Hi there! I’m Hichem, a passionate web developer driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving.
                My coding journey began in high school, where I built a simple Pascale game that sparked my fascination
                with creating tools people interact with daily. Since then, my dedication to understanding the mechanics
                behind technology has only grown stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a detail-oriented, collaborative, and adaptable individual who thrives on making online experiences
                seamless and accessible. For me, the most rewarding part of being a web developer is knowing my work enhances
                lives, whether by solving a problem or simply improving someone’s digital journey.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Background and Experience -->
        <section id="background" aria-labelledby="background-experience">
            <h2 id="background-experience">Background & Experience</h2>
            <p>
                My professional journey has been a rewarding adventure, filled with opportunities to create, collaborate,
                and grow. One of my proudest accomplishments was developing an e-commerce platform for a small business
                that significantly boosted their sales and market reach. Seeing my work translate into tangible results
                is what keeps me motivated.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few highlights of my experience:</p>
            <ul class="custom-list">
                <li>Proficient in modern frameworks like Vue.js and Java Spring Boot</li>
                <li>Developed scalable applications using Docker and microservices</li>
                <li>Managed agile development projects with a focus on client satisfaction</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Values and Goals Section -->
        <section id="values" aria-labelledby="values-goals">
            <h2 id="values-goals">Values & Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My work is guided by the belief that technology can improve lives in meaningful ways. Beyond development,
                I am passionate about mental health awareness, promoting diversity, and improving life quality. For instance,
                I’ve participated in workplace initiatives to create inclusive environments and championed projects that
                bridge technology with healthier living.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, I aspire to lead a team specializing in cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning
                while mentoring aspiring developers. Through open-source contributions and knowledge-sharing initiatives, I aim
                to empower communities to innovate and grow.

            <p>
                Outside of coding, I love experimenting in the kitchen, blending recipes from diverse cultures into new creations.
                Traveling to over 15 countries has been a source of inspiration, from hiking in breathtaking landscapes to trying
                unique cuisines. Here are a few fun facts about me:
